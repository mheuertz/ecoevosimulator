- Abrupt tranistion in Paracou plots seems to matter for species divergence, maybe we should try to run TWI on generated topography
- Cell size of Paracou is 3x3m, ideally the size should be of a typical reproducing adult tree in canopy
- Spelling: ruggedness
- Spelling: diamond-square
- possibility to repeat a simul on the same topography; 
- possibility to simulate a novel diamon-square topography with the same params otherwise
